# MangaAnalyser


It is small and some buggy tool, which provide some fuctionality for assisting translations of manga.

# Why

The main problems of translating are:
1) Don't know Japan language
2) Up to down and right to left sequence of hieroglyphs.

So. I'm trying to solve it.

# Dependencies


1) It is written on C# VS 2008 on WinForms.
2) It is using some hack of google translate
3) It is usnig [http://weocr.ocrgrid.org/] recognitor of Japan language. If you want you can install it at your PC and use local translation server.

Of course it cannot give fully correct recognition and/or translation but I hope sometimes it can assists.
